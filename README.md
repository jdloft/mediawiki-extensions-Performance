Performance
===============================

Performance is a MediaWiki extension that provides a flexible utility panel for MediaWiki. Plans are to integrate into Winter (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Winter) and Flow (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Flow) and other extensions that are released with the core-features team. Performance will provide similar functionality to Twinkle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TW) but will be customizable to each page, namespace, and/or project.
